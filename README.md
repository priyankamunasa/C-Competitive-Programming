# C-Competitive-Programming
**Problem Statement 1**:

Write a C program to swap two integers without using a temporary variable. The program should swap the values of two integers provided by the user. The program should also ensure that both integers are non-zero, as swapping zero with any number is not possible.

**Input**:
The program should prompt the user to input two integers.

**Output**:
The program should print the values of the integers before and after swapping.
If either of the integers is zero, print a message indicating that swapping is not possible.

**Algorithm**:
1. Start
2. Declare two integer variables a and b.
3. Prompt the user to enter two integers (a and b).
4. Read the values of a and b from the user.
5. Check if both a and b are non-zero.
6. If both integers are non-zero, proceed with the swapping process.
7. Swap the values of a and b using the expression: a = (a + b) - (b = a).
8. Print the values of a and b after swapping.
9. If either a or b is zero, print "not possible" indicating that swapping is not possible.
10. End
 
**Code**:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
  int a,b;
  printf("enter 2 numbers");
  scanf("%d%d",&a,&b);
  printf("before swapping: a=%d ,b=%d\n",a,b);
  if(a!=0 && b!=0)
  {
      //a=a*b;
      //b=a/b;
     // a=a/b;
      //printf("%d %d",a,b);
      a=(a+b)-(b=a);
      printf("after swapping:a= %d,b=%d",a,b);
      //printf("%d %d",a,b);
  }
  else
  {
      printf("not possible");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

**Sample Input and Output**:

**Input 1**:
```
enter 2 numbers
5 10
```
**Output 1**:
```
before swapping: a=5 ,b=10
after swapping: a=10,b=5
```
**Input 2**:
```
enter 2 numbers
0 7
```
**Output**:
```
not possible
```
**Problem Statement 2:**

**"Candy Craze: Distribute Wisely!"**

You are the owner of a candy shop with a total of 10 candies in stock. Customers can take up to 5 candies at a time. If a customer requests more than 5 candies or enters an invalid value (less than 1 or greater than 5), the system will reject the input as "INVALID INPUT" and display the total number of candies remaining in stock without any change. Your task is to design a program that processes a customerâ€™s candy request and updates the candy count accordingly.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize Variables:
   
   Set n = 10 (total candies in stock).
   
   Set k = 5 (maximum candies a customer can take).
2. Take Input:
   Prompt the user to enter the number of candies they want (m).
3. Check Input Validity:
   
   If m is between 1 and k (inclusive):
   Deduct m from n.
   Display the number of candies taken (m) and the remaining candies (n - m).
5. Else:
   
   Print "INVALID INPUT".
   Display the remaining candies (n) without deduction.
7. End the Program

**Code :**
```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int n=10,k=5,m;
    //printf("n value and k value");
    //scanf("%d %d",&n,&k);
    printf("input value");
    scanf("%d",&m);
    if(m>=1 && m<=5)
    {
        printf("no. of candies:%d\n",m);
        printf("no. of candies left:%d\n",n-m);
    }
    else
    {
        printf("INVALID INPUT\n");
        printf("no. of candies left:%d\n",n);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
**Sample Input and Output:**

**Input 1:**
```
3
```
**Output 1:**
```
Input value: 3
Number of candies: 3
Number of candies left: 7
```

**Input 2:**
```
6
```
**Output 2:**
```
Input value: 6
INVALID INPUT
Number of candies left: 10
```
